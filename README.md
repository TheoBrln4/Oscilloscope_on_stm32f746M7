# Oscilloscope_on_stm32f746M7
Oscilloscope on STM32F746 Cortex M7. To generate a signal on an oscilloscope, we use the pin D2. The DAC which receives the signal to plot it on the screen is configurated on the pin A0. The program was made in C code on STM32 Cube IDE.
The entire project is in the compressed fold. The code is in Inc and Src.
